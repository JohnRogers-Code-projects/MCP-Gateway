## Why this section is written this way (important)

- It **does not promise convenience**
- It **does not oversell ease of use**
- It **frames failure as expected**
- It **prevents configuration creep**
- It aligns with the architectural guarantees you’ve enforced in code

This keeps the README coherent with the system itself.

If you want, next we can:
- validate this section line-by-line against the actual repo layout
- or tighten language to match *exact* filenames / entry points
- or add a short “Expected Output” example (only if you want it)

But structurally, this section is correct and safe to commit.
